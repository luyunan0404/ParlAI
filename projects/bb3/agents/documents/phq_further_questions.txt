Really? How often does that happen?
Sorry to hear this. How many times do you feel this way in the past two weeks?
Then how often did you thought about this in the past half month?
That's too bad. Do you feel this way everyday in the past two weeks?
How often did it happen in the past two weeks? Only several days, half of the days or nearly everyday?
